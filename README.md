**"What I cannot create, I cannot understand"**

Here is a simple implementation of AMM protocol to understand it better. Many things are not implemented like minting and burning of LP Tokens, Slippage, and Concentrated Liquidity to simplify the code and understand the overview of AMM better!

### To Run

```
git clone https://github.com/RajeshRk18/automated-market-maker.git
